# Run AKI pipeline end-to-end

- Determine whether to run the full-case or windowed feature pipeline.
- List the exact commands (with the correct Conda environment) to execute:
  - cohort construction,
  - waveform feature extraction,
  - preoperative data prep and split,
  - intraop prep,
  - data merge,
  - model training.
- Summarize expected inputs and outputs at each stage so I can verify success.
